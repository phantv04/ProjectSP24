    "Between a country's population and how much of their GDP is allocated to sports, is there a relationship to how well their respective athletes do in medal placements (gold, silver, bronze) at the Olympics?

    "One cannot deny the substantial revenues that the annual Olympics bring to many countries throughout the sporting world. According to an article from the International Olympic Committee, $590 million is usually spent towards athlete development, training of coaches and players, and the accessibility of the Olympic Games throughout the world. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Some argue that the reason for these funding is due to the economic boom that might potentially happen as the Olympics encourage more tourism. After reading some background information on this topic, our group have decided to propose a tentative question: is it true that the higher the GDP of a country in that Olympic year, the higher the medal value they will receive? We would also do research on other factors, such as population size and healthcare accessibility, but we chose the Olympics because it is known to be the largest sporting celebration in terms of the number of events, athletes, and people gathered from the world for this annual event.\n",
    "\n",
    "A published work that has been completed on this topic is from a few students at Georgia Institute of Technology, where they argued that GDP per capita is the main determinant to a country’s Olympic performance. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-2) However, after doing their research, they realized that a country’s size and healthcare expenditures per capita are the main factors that drive Olympic performance, rather than GDP per capita. To us, this is a valid argument because in the end, the better the general welfare of a country is the better their healthcare will be and athletes will have a higher chance of having better healthcare. Additionally, after analyzing some unrestricted multiple variable regression models, this group realized that the relationship between Olympic performance, country’s size, and per capita health expenditure make more sense and these were the only variables that were significant at the 5% level.\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at this published project, we decided to consider other factors besides GDP. This project also includes the healthcare that a country receives as a factor, but we also want to see if the amount of spending and expenditures that are allocated to sports have an affect on the medals that a country receive during the Olympics. There are a lot of hidden factors that might impact athletes’ performances during this event, but the purpose of this project is to see which factors are the most significant. We also want to see if a country’s population has an affect on one’s standing in the Olympics (i.e., is it true that the larger the population size, the more likely a country is to do better?).\n",

    "The hypothesis we suppose is that more allocation of government spending/expenditure towards athletes and sports, in general, should translate to better performance and better medal placements of athletes at the Olympics, whereas population isn't as a significant contributor, given that the resources needed to succeed in sports (training equipment, facilities) is an overall better metric for athletes' performance. We think this for the first point, as preliminary research has looked at the relationship between healthcare expenditures and performance, with healthcare being a strong indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would make sense, then, that how much of government spending is allocated towards sports should then be a stronger indicator of Olympic performance; the resources that are necessary for an athlete to succeed obviously include access to the best healthcare, but, more importantly, their access to top of the line sports resources (better facilities, equipment, training.)"

We can use this dataset to see what countries have more winners and after discovering this, we can perform research on factors such as GDP that might contribute to their outstanding performances during the Olympics. Since this dataset has a lot of datapoints, we will most likely use a scatterplot to compare the relationship between two variables such as country and success.\n",

We can possibly research the GDP and other factors of some countries that have high success because there could possibly be a relationship between the resources that they receive and their performane during the Olympics. Since this dataset is so large, we will most likely use scatterplots to represent data and perform some sort of linear regression to clearly see relationships (positive relationship, clear distinction between two countries, etc.).\n",

    "Both of these data sources can play an important role in our research project because they provide a lot of players that participated in the Olympics and won a medal. We can pull examples from both datasets of players in certain countries (most likely the ones that have more victories in the Olympics) and see if there is a correlation between their successes and factors such as their population and GDP. Hopefully, we can use these examples to argue that according to our hypothesis, the government's expenditures towards sports has an affect on athletes' performances during the Olympics, while population is an important factor, but not as prominent as government spending.\n",

    "Some issues with the data provided thus far largely stem from terms of use. While some do specify it is avaliable for public domain, as in the case of '120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results' dataset we provided, as we go along and find more datasets online, it is important to see if 1. this data is for public use and 2. respectively cite/link to those projects/websites where we had collected them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One ethical concern that may arise in our dataset particularly affects the way we are able to do work on the Olympic data, is that not all countries competed/could compete for the Olympics, so certain countries with 'head start' may show themselves to be 'better performers' when the sample of athletes may only be comprised of a few countries. One way of handling this problem is to look at when most, if not all, countries were approved to send athletes to the Olympics. By looking at these datas, we may be able to separate eras of Olympics and what countries competed in them to look at the broader picture of performance, and then do the GDP/population work therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is the presentation of GDP as a signficant factor in Olympic performance, a bias we have already addressed and should strive to keep in mind. We've mentioned in the background how in one study, they found out that healthcare and the country's size, rather than GDP per capita, are stronger factors in relation to Olympic performance. As such, it's important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily about GDP, but of what percent/how much of that spending is allocated to sports and sports enhancement, which is a key part of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues with our topic date is that, while there may be data stretching all the way from 1896 for the Olympics, the data for countries' GDP that is made avaliable to the public may not stretch as far, and may not even be as accurate as we would require it to be. We would then need to line up the data that is available for both to then collect and do analysis work on it. \n"
